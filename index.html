                <p>I am a PhD candidate in the Department of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering at Case Western Reserve University, with research interests in fire science and engineering, fire safety, buoyancy flow, combustion, and flame spread in varied ambient environment conditions (reduced pressure, reduced oxygen, microgravity, normal gravity and partial gravity). My research work focuses on experimental combustion dynamics, particularly in fire safety, where I have performed studies on flame spread under varying pressure and oxygen conditions, fire blanket performance, and pyrolysis characteristics of materials. I also possess hands-on experience with lab equipment, such as thermogravimetric analysis systems and combustion chambers, and have developed custom LabVIEW and MATLAB programs for data collection and post-processing.</p>

        <p>I also have a Master’s degree from the University of Chinese Academy of Sciences and a Bachelor’s degree in Mechanical Engineering from Kathmandu University. During my Master’s studies, my thesis focused on the experimental study of surge waves generated by ice avalanches and their impact on moraine dam failure. This work included a state-of-the-art review of moraine dam failure processes, an analysis of avalanche granularity, and the development of machine learning models to predict peak discharge based on experimental data.</p>
        <p>Additionally, I worked as a Hydropower Asset Verification Engineer at ERMC Nepal, where I was responsible for inspecting and verifying the mechanical and electrical components of hydropower plants. Throughout my academic and professional journey, I have developed strong skills in programming (MATLAB, Python, LabVIEW), simulation (ANSYS Fluent), and data analysis, alongside a commitment to mentoring students and serving as a teaching assistant for core mechanical engineering courses.</p>
